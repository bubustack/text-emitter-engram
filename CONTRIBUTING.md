# Contributing to text-emitter-engram

Thank you for considering a contribution—your help keeps this repository healthy for every bobrapet Story.

This guide explains how we work in the `text-emitter-engram` repository, from filing issues to sending patches.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Search for an existing report under [Issues](https://github.com/bubustack/text-emitter-engram/issues).
- If nothing matches, [open a new issue](https://github.com/bubustack/text-emitter-engram/issues/new) with a clear description, reproduction steps, and both observed and expected behaviour.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Start a thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/bubustack/discussions) or file a feature request issue.
- Document motivating use-cases, proposed config additions, and any compatibility considerations for existing Stories.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and branch from `main`.
- Keep changes focused; additive config should include manifest updates (`Engram.yaml` or `Impulse.yaml`) and README documentation.
- Run the quality gates locally:
  - `make lint`
  - `make test`
  - `make docker-build IMG=ghcr.io/<your-user>/text-emitter-engram:dev` when binaries or Dockerfile paths change
- Open the PR with a summary, testing evidence, and any follow-up TODOs.
